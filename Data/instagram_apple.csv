0,5,False,2020-12-23 07:09:20,babyaggu,Stop promoting reels insanely,I get the fact that Instagram wants to expand its user base remarkably and grab all the traffic of tiktok. But then you can’t disrespect your old people who have been following your old algorithm and have grown at a snails pace in last two years. We have invested so much money and energy to reach where we are today. I am still struggling to get my 2000 followers to reach 30k since one month. And new accounts are touching 100 in a week. Are you trying to mock at us Instagram?  What are you up to? Sorry but we can simply shift to reels like that. It works on a different algorithm plus we can’t droop to that level and create mindless videos which doesn’t impart any value other than fun. Had we loved tiktok why would we have remained so consistent with you. Plz do something for your old accounts as well. Or else we might leave your platform and go elsewhere. Many have started leaving as well. Instagram has become nothing less than a garbage now with stupid jokes and vulgar dances etc... Please respect your old and basic work ethics. Thanks.

I was asked to change my password and I change it then my all action was blocked like I can’t like any picture of my followers and unable to send requests, accept the request and comment it has been block for 7 days . This is very frustrating I reported so many times but didn’t get any solution and I mailed also but didn’t get reply . I have never violations any community guidelines of social media playform.

Facebook is now making Instagram cringe by merging messenger features and changing the entire interface of Instagram. It’s not user friendly anymore. When Facebook started being changes on Facebook, we stopped using it and now the same is happening with Instagram too. Don’t let us stop using Instagram by bringing and merging Facebook with Instagram. It’s frustrating. Why do you want ya to chat with the ones using messenger? Why?

I've loved your app for all the good reasons. But since past few months I've been constantly reporting about my problem and it is not fixed till this very moment. Your app is providing various fonts on story button and even after updating with all the latest versions I'm still not getting those fonts in my id. And even after reporting like 4-5 times, there still no actions taken. 
And its not about only font styles but it is about the difference you guys are creating by not providing equal options to every user. Even in my nears and dears i see they don't have music on story option even earlier it was available and one day it's gone just like that. The same has happened with me in the past, thats not professionalism that your app suddenly take away the existing options and some have opportunity to use and some can't get same options with all the latest updates. I have never experienced this kind of issue in any other application, where everyone have different accessibilities with similar updation. This is very unfair and disappointing."

But on June 26th, 2020, I received a pop up message from Instagram saying that I had been using third party services to boost my likes and followers. I have never done that. Normally, I would’ve waited this one out for the next 24-48 hours, but this time, Instagram has blocked me for a whole week (till 3rd July, 2020). I’ve also gotten a warning that if they suspected I was doing this again, they might terminate my account. Again, I’ve never used third party services or apps. I really have no idea how this happened. Have I been hacked? I’ve been using Instagram for four years and I have always been very responsible. Is it a bug in the app? Also, I tried reporting the problem multiple times but I got no response. I really do not want to be banned. Hope you look into this matter. If not, I have been considering uninstalling the app."

Also why the why are you removed smooth scrolling which need to put more energy to scroll to next post sometimes I have to scroll two times. Why can’t you keep it simple. If you make this annoying updates in this I’m going to uninstall this garbage app.  I literally didn’t like that. You guys made same type of mistakes in Facebook now you are facing less number of users. Don’t do like Facebook. I’ve been facing lot of bugs in Instagram. If not like Facebook this is also going to be in bin. Sometimes I won’t get search options then I need to force close the app and open it again. Also recent update when I tried to refresh the explore section it shows again same posts and even shows the hid posts again and again.

I don’t think I’ve ever done anything against “community guidelines” for Instagram to block me from liking, commenting and following for a certain period of time. The “tell us” option that’s given to us doesn’t seem to have an use and it’s probably just piling up everytime someone clicks that option. I see Instagram updating pretty often “fixings bugs” but this is a bigger issue which just hasn’t been resolved for a while. I think till date I’ve had atleast 10-12 times where I’ve been blocked for a certain number of days and it’s not good if you’re an artist on Instagram.

It’s the first thing I look at in the morning and the last thing I look at before I sleep. However, one thing that annoys and angers me to no extent is the bots that do the security check for reports. Every time I report something very, very abusive/sexist/racist, I ALWAYS get a message saying “this does not violate our community guidelines” or so. That too, after a few hours and when the content is really blatantly hateful and abusive. I understand if you have installed bots to detect swear words and all, but that is something so compact that it really does not help at all. I have reported this issue so many times now, and there have been so many updates to Instagram, but NO ACTION TAKEN WHATSOEVER. The last straw for me was today when I was just happily keyboard smashing out of pure excitement, and I was immediately restricted from commenting for a bit because I was apparently misusing this feature and my content violated Instagram guidelines.

My account has been temporarily blocked again. And this isn’t the first time it has happened but the 5th. My account is banned for a week because it says i’m involved in third party apps to gain more like and followers but i can assure you there is nothing like it. And my account has around 4000 followers. In normal circumstances, i would have just deleted my account and created a new id or if this ban had just lasted for a week then also, it would’ve been bearable. But this is the 5th time my account has been disabled from liking, commenting, following, unfollowing and posting. This is a repetitive process and my account keeps on getting banned. This is very frustrating and i have also tried to report this problem several times but there was no response from your side and the only response i keep on getting is another weekly ban on my account. I request you to please look into this matter and end this charade once and for all. Just unban my account and don’t brinv the ban again.

33,3,False,2020-09-26 13:07:22,Kathan_Patel,"Love Instagram, but reels 😪","Since the new update, when the reels feature introduced, personally I don’t like reels. I must say, the User experience is not good.

The explore button is on the top navigation bar. We can’t switch between different screens. In the previous version, we can switch between explore, home, direct messages, activity, and profile screen. But in this new version, we can’t. 

Every time we go to explore and come back to home, we lost where we are in explore screen and every time It shows a first upper post where we started or an updated screen.

Quick Solution (suggestion):

If Instagram can replace the explore button and put where it was in bottom navigation bar, It’ll be easy for switching screens. The reels button will go in top navigation bar where the explore button is.

Reason: 

When we are watching reels, It’s just a single screen at a time, and we can go back to it where we left off. But in explore we are seeing grid system feed. 

There are also other reasons behind this, since we are using this learned behaviour of clicking the explore button in bottom navigation bar. like when we talk about functional & navigation consistency.

So I think, this is a significant step towards ensuring a consistent experience across the previous and new version of this product. 

So to conclude if reel button will replace with explore feature, I’ll be more than happy. 😄"

Firstly, i would like to mention that you should put an option of private messaging. ( i want to say that there should be option for us whether we want receive messages from outsiders or not) 
I receive many fake and abusive messages from people whom i don’t know. It comes up in message request but still it hurts.. i only want that I couldn’t get any message till the time i don’t add the person in my account. 

Secondly, 
Instagram shows our account in suggestions , and i receive many useless friend requests which i don’t want even. So it must be an option whether we want to show our account in suggestion or not. 

Thirdly, 
Facebook provide an option of hiding our friends. Instagram should also have the same application.  

Instagram is best but not better than snapchat . Yes it have filters and everything. But still safety matters alot . And i want you to these changes so that i could rate it 5 . And feel secure. Hope you will do . Thank you.

I sent you the feedback so many times. But you didn’t took any action for it. 
How disgusting.!! If we are giving you feedback it doesn’t mean that we are complaining you, but the point is that we want you change some options so that it could get good ratings. Please sir i request you again . Take an action for it.🙏🏻"

I do receive a load of follow requests which I delete daily and thus would not require such means. The liking issue has also caused me to continuously delete and re-download the app which is 4-5 times this week. Furthermore it caused a random call for change of password by giving a false alarm regarding compromising of the password. The app update too has destroyed the smooth flow of the app. It was a good social media platform which is being ruined by the day. I have been unblocked after the above incident only recently and have been reblocked saying I have not followed community guideline. I shall henceforth restrict my use of this social media platform and inform the other the same. Cause this is not a funny thing.

What if my category of posts are not to be saved or shared but are just me sharing the photographs I click and like to share with others?

Please look into the matter since changing and remembering the password is a big task and if not that not being able to like pictures and comment for a week over a useless excuse by the app is even worse. And the app not being able respond back to my complaints is to be honest the worst.

I have been an active user and he always wondered if the video in the story could b uploaded as long as it is and not only first 15 seconds.. bcz if i wanna upload a video which is like 60 seconds.. I have to edit it in the gallery and make 4 videos of 15 seconds and only then it can b uploaded in 4 different videos where my friend can upload a video no matter how long it is on his samsung mobile.. He did upload a video which was like 180 seconds in his story which eventually got uploaded as many different stories of 15 seconds.. He has this feature on his Instagram app itself where I miss this feature terribly.. Can something b done abt this feature being added to the iphone app too.. ??

I have reported this issue more or less like 1000 times (instagram you can check the figure) but I have never got this thing sorted by instagram. Neither I got any reply from instagram regarding this. My page reach is highly affected due to this and I am not able to post reels on my page. I don’t had any option to communicate with instagram so I am forcefully to posting my review here. I gave 4* to instagram because it has helped me to share my passion with people across the world. I have learnt a lot and I have shared my knowledge to others but somehow this technical error is slowing my growth.

1. The landscape of social networking has been altered greatly, given that snapchat had started a revolution in the messaging game, Insta has cemented it's place on a whole different level.
2. The camera filters and all the other features for a photo publishing platform is of highest importance. As a rookie photographer; and we know nowadays pretty much everyone is one! :P I can say that I am thrilled with the features available!

If you haven't already get on board the Insta express and be prepared for a completely unique and amazing networking experience! :D"

Have you heard about ""fear of
missing out"" well if you haven't then
let me tell you that this is a
psychological damage which has
been caused to me because of
you people after you have removed the feature of ""following activity"". The
reason why Instagram is most
accessed is because people are
social animals who want to connect
to people and that was the only way
to know about various stuff present
on the internet be it gossip or
what's trending or the different
pages which we personally connect
with and even about the people who
we follow and all that was only
possible because of the particular
feature. We have become so used
to that particular feature and so
addicted to Instagram because that
was the only way to get to know
about some really cool pages.
Back Ratings & Reviews
about some really cool pages and
now it's like we no longer have
access to information and feel
confined only to that which we
already know. Instagram was the
number - app because of that particular feature and after this feature being removed there's nothing more left to do on
Instagram nor do i find any other
reason to be on Instagram if this
feature doesn't come back. If you
have taken that feature down you
might as well take down the entire
app because there is nothing left to
do. So I kindly request you to get this feature back as soon as
possible.

Please help

Thank You"

I am unable to like/comment on posts or follow/unfollow other accounts. The display message says something about protecting the community. So I haven’t posted anything that violates community guidelines and I haven’t been involved in any unconventional activities on this particular network. I am completely unaware of the cause of this prompt and I have reported it from my end. In hopes of solving this problem, I uninstalled the application and planned on reinstalling it.

One of my accounts- the one i primarily use- gets updated on time and is always up to date with ‘reels’, etc. However, my second account doesn’t get updated and I can’t even fix that. If you are rolling out updates in stages, I’d suggest you roll them out for BOTH my accounts at the same time since it’s inconvenient using two separate versions. I still don’t have the reels feature on my other account and rarely can see the content my friends send me. It’s very inconvenient & there seems to be no foreseeable way to fix it.

Also the list of following in profile is getting arranged on its own in any order and not in the latest following order which is another annoying thing happening on Instagram. Instagram is such an interesting application and getting hype day by day so don’t just update it in any way you like ,  By doing this you’ll lose your users. Instagram is loved by people because of its interesting features.. don’t just remove or add features according to you, think from your users side. People love your app that doesn’t mean you’ll give them anything in return. Your overconfidence and over smartness will make you lose your users and popularity.

But From last 3 to 4 days I’m getting an pop up on my screen as “Action Blocked” which was very annoying and was pretending that it might be an issue so ignored.
But, even after complete one day the same pop so that made me very frustrating and so searched Internet got to know that the action is blocked due to below reason:-

You have been aggressively following and unfollowing people.
You used a third-party app to get likes on your pictures.
You used a third-party app to get more followers or to auto-follow and auto-unfollow followers.
You used the same comment multiple times.
You have a habit of liking many pictures in a short span of time.

But after checking my account you’ll come to know that I had done nothing of the above still my Account is showing the same pop up.
It’s very painful, frustrating that even after such clean account I’m getting an error. So I uninstalled Instagram after using 2 days with continuous error.

The problem is that it is just an iOS application ported to iPad. The UI isn’t crisp, the pictures are low resolution, and everything makes it feels like it is not made for iPad every time. I understand that there is a default size option but then It feels awkward looking at the small portion with giant black useless space. 
Just take Reddit or Twitter for example, everything work fine and I don’t feel like I’m using something leftover. Come on, you guys can do better.

When scrolling becomes too much, no one ever realises when they use Instagram. 

You can quickly create an account. It is super easy. But it has its own pros and cons: Instagram can be an abundant source of inspiration, and at the same time, it can be addictive as cocaine. 

You should invest your time with caution, keeping in mind how much time is sufficient for you to feel that you are not missing out on important posts or something. 

Excessive usage, for example, continuous texting on DM and scrolling can lead to thumb fatigue and even numb your arms for a while. This can be injurious if the numbness lasts way too long. 

Take short breaks after every fifteen minutes, close your eyes, shake your arms and hands, et cætera. 

And not to forget, with freedom comes responsibility, so use this application while respecting the feelings of others in the comments’ section, for example. 

Lastly, beware of catfishing."

And I’ve been getting a lot of followers from past few days. But today even though I am getting notifications of new followers the number of followers seems to stuck on 1877. Whereas when I open my account from a different login the followers count shows 1906. I have no idea why it’s happening. It maybe a glitch or something. I haven’t got any ban from instagram as far as I have checked. 

Kindly look into the problem. As many instagram users are facing the same problem but haven’t got the explanation for it.

I dont even figure out, whats wrong if I am trying to like photos of my friends on social media. This is not something which I am liking random pics of anyone and doing any offensive things. I am trying to like picture of my friends who are my followers also the one who accepted my following requests. Have reported this issue thousands of time still there is nothing, no reply.

Instagram's policy has downgraded so much and it is almost ridiculuos to see my favourite creators' account being deleted overnight.

Say there are 100 saved items and I want to view them one-by-one and if there is one reels video there in between and I entered in reels mode to view it in full screen-mode, it shows related videos but not the next item from saved item when I swipe up.

That’s nice feature to have on home page or in reels section. But I don’t think it make sense to have it in saved items section. As user is much interested in saved items other than suggestions. I know it’s not impacting your business but some users experience for sure. And I think users experience matters than business as it helps to grow the business.

There are 2 things that i totally cannot agree to. 

Firstly, l hate that you have changed the visual of a User(s) main post feed page visual as reels page looks, I don’t understand why my main IG posts page also has to look like the Reels page. 
I would like it if I don’t feel like Instagram has turned into reels completely. That would ruin the whole experience of using the app. I would like to have my main IG page which contains all my posts to look like how it did earlier to this update. 

Secondly, when I share another user(s) story of, or an IGTV or reel, as my story, the complete video can be previewed in my story itself and that cuts down so many profile views to the user. I always wondered why the team would want to cut down profile visit and viewership.

Also, if you could add a search option for messages, because of the large ammount of screen space the insta msgs carry, it’s difficult to even scroll up to a yesterday’s chat.

Only complaint is not liking few new filters , if want to add new ones just don't remove old ones, and why we can see who was active before 5 min back , 30 min or 1/2 hours ago , that looks like what's online thing, that gives trouble if we don't want to answer someone , it looks rude in our part that they are active still not checking and we might be doing some surfing part or reading some captions or articles! 
Rest of these two things , Instagram is my most favorite app!"

Can we have that dark mode if any one wants to switch to dark mode so the can switch to ?  It would take Instagram at different level. Maybe  Everyone will love it.

A medium where penning of your experiences is shared with your followers and have a word or two in the topic. Some people value the importance and credibility of the post basis the likes shared comments, but for me it was just sharing my experience with a bunch of like minded people whose simple smiley or just a word comment or a like can help you sense what they meant and how they understand! #keepitupinsta #raisethebarinsta #keepcreatinginstcontent"

I run a fan account and bcz of its new updates, it became difficult to run a fan page not only for me but for a lot of fanpage account owners. Because of it a lot of them are feeling so unmotivated. If u have less than 1k followers or don’t get 100likes on ur post it would becomes so difficult bcz u don’t have any audience to see your edits or post. Instagram should make some changes and make it a bit easy for the fan page users to grow their accounts bcz it’s so difficult to run an account in these new updates."

I thought it may be because the account is new maybe it will be work in 2 3 days and i waited for around 5 days. But after 5 days the feature was not working yet then I reported this problem in help centre of Instagram and i waited for 48 hours but after 48 hours it was not working and after that i have reported about 10-15 times in last 15 days and i also wrote a mail to Instagram support mail id but the team is not resolving my problem after i have done all these reports and mail and even they are not replying or giving any reason for this problem.

I don’t see any reason you think I’m a robot and think that I’m going against the community guidelines. This never happened before.

187,5,False,2020-08-26 07:05:51,Shreyap98,This app keeps getting better & better,I absolutely LOVE the newer updates - reels > tiktok & the fact that now it shows you who else from your following list also follows the same acc as you before you send a post is sooooo convienent (private accs show the posts to be unavailable if you share it & the person isn’t following). No more checking to see if they follow the acc too/ taking screenshots/ screen recording. These little improvements definitely do matter. If it keeps going like this I’m super sure all other apps will become rudimentary.
188,5,False,2020-07-16 04:05:48,cut faghegjsh,Worst performance,"First , I lost my account on violation of community guidelines. I still don't know what i violated. No communication on that. Just got to know i was pretending to be someone. I have a twin sister who looks similar to me. If someone reports you just blindly remove the account without even checking. Such a pathetic service.
I tried to restore my account . Tried all the means, no response, no info, nothing. Pathetic service.

Second, i cant give more likes to posts. What a crap. Then y are you allowing them to post if people cant give likes beyond a limit."

The posts they like, the comments, etc. I find it pretty disturbing because that feature kepts people close and more connected, is what i feel.

But if you have seen now it's not there anymore. But you will see some bug in it while long pressing the multiple photos post, that there is some flickering happening at the bottom of the photo. Which i think is the bug which is not allowing to view the rest photos. And forces us to eventually opening the whole post. So do have a look into it. I would be glad if you resume that feature again. Thats quite a time saving feature.

Please, make its separate UI to fit perfectly with the environment of IPads screen too. I hope you will take concrete actions on it as soon as possible. Thanks!!!

194,5,False,2018-12-27 15:25:38,angrybub,IM DISAPPOINTED,"okay instagram was a really cool app at first and all but now they have this new update that changes how we view posts.
we now view posts like watching instagram stories and i feel that this is very annoying because we can’t properly view the post or see the comments because before i touch anything it swipes to the next post.
logically insta stories last for 24 hours
whereas posts last forever till you delete it so introducing both features to be of the same kind kind of disturbs users as we feel instagram posts aren’t as important as before .
due to this difficulty i’ve seen the algorithm of instagram change . what is supposed to cover a wider audience now covers lesser and the root cause of this is the update
 i personally feel it’s not user friendly and even the iconic “double taping “ is hard 
i want to express my disappointment as the features that we love are slowly being taken off 
thank you instagram"
195,5,False,2018-12-02 17:15:39,ASD_SIDHBARI,Stories,"Everything’s excellent but just one niche, there should be an option to show the IG story only to a few people. For example if I have a thousand followers & I wanna show my story to only to a few followers whom I personally know much better, there should be an option to select them (take Whatsapp stories as an example where we can shortlisted whom all we want to check out our stories).
The close friends thing would be better had you not given that green halo behind the profile picture to check the story, my take is - Replace that green halo with the red one like usual."
