0,ABWolverine,10-02-2021 18:45,4,"The initial roll out of the app has been good. The interface is fresh, colour scheme is also mild. It is closer to KakaoStory, than Twitter, in that sense. 
Given the user base is growing exponentially at this point, glitches are expected and I hope the developers scale up the server and bandwidth facilities soon. 
Some search, tag and syntax issues are present and I think the developers will work on those soon. 
I hope the ethos of the app remains the same on coming days. The domestic servers, the freedom within the constitutional framework of India is the biggest catch of the app. If it becomes user friendly in coming days, it might soon be a serious contender for both Twitter and Facebook, for that matter.

1,Bongoshingho,18-08-2020 13:33,1,"Hi
I have absolutely no problem as such with the concept of this App. Koo is a great app for netizens from India. However, if this App truly claims to represent the pulse and the culture of this country then I fail to understand how an important aspect of Indians: multilingualism was overlooked by the developers. Many Indians are bilingual at least, and I'm not talking about English as one of the languages. One can speak odia and Marathi. Or Telugu and Kannada so on and so forth.
However there is no option to use Koo simultaneously in two versions (ie. two languages) The condition for that is you need seperate numbers. I don't get the logic. I have just one number yet I speak three languages and I'd love to use Koo in three languages as well. Now, where should I get three phone numbers from?
Please change/modify this feature asap and make one number to be sufficient for the hundreds of thousands of multilingual folks of this country to use Koo.",Unify the App. Take in to consideration the multilingual folks of India üáÆüá≥,FALSE,"{'id': 17666638, 'body': ""Hi, Thank you for your feedback.
