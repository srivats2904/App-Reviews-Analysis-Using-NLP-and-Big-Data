0,False,5,Some improvements,abhinav.s,2020-04-08 14:51:18,"Could do a better job filtering propaganda . Sometimes during a crucial time , a lot of misinformation gets spread as a ‚Äútrend‚Äù meaning a lot of misinformation is actively propagated by the filtering algorithms . Coupled with bot behaviour this could be quite catastrophic. The app is still unmatched in terms of quality, access and originality of information available from accurate sources. I have to keep my followers/following very tightly regulated for the best experience and read ‚Äútrends‚Äù with a grain of salt . Best wishes for the years ahead as twitter plays an increasing crucial role in a free and open society!"
1,False,3,Recommandation/Suggestion,Chiru1108,2020-02-03 17:44:35,"Your system is recommending/suggesting me the posts which are far out of my interest. I do not have any problem with recommendations/suggestions but it is sending me notifications a lot for nothing. I am good with this system when I am actually surfing it but I do not like it to ping my cell or iPad or all devices I have.
Still, your thing is better than any other social media preventing rumours so I still like it but if possible please stop pinging notifications of recommendations/suggestions. Some people would say me to turn off notification of it in setting but I can not because I have some important people i have followed and I need to keep notifications ‚ÄúON‚Äù."
2,False,1,Increase the words allowed,BikramSaluja,2020-11-25 07:52:00,"You need to increase the word count to atleast get a short para in... one has to draft and redraft posting things on instagram / facebook / twitter... just too much time goes in that... for someone who isnt sharing news and daily affairs but stories and storytelling they need more words to compress their journey/experience in... lot of time gets wasted in getting it to your word count or else one has to break up a story into different parts which dilutes the whole experience for the viewer/reader. This is a major deterrent for creative people like me who wants to use twitter to reach out to people about their stories... it cant just be a platform for expressing opinions, politics and debates alone... it needs to be inclusive and let people use it to spread what they believe in easily and comfortably..."
3,False,5,Universal Twitter.,speakinghill,2019-10-16 13:35:02,"I have always wondered about life and it‚Äôs pulls and pushes which do not let‚Äôs you think in your own way . But still, I think there are brilliant thinkers all over the world particularly in US, who lets You stay as part of the world and express yourself if you have an idea or an opinion that‚Äôs worthwhile for the humanity . Twitter is one such amazing idea and a platform that lets you to think and express.  I wish Twitter continues to enable the universal thinking population to achieve health wealth and happiness by creating the world that cares shares and stay useful."
4,False,5,Rating 1 star due to a frustrating bug,Alok Malik,2017-11-21 18:52:12,"This app doesn't work properly on slow connections where after clicking on tweet other tweets in that thread take time to load. Whenever I try to scroll up after clicking a tweet before it's upper tweets have loaded, it resets the scroll and takes me to top tweet. This is always frustrating, even if I touch the scroll a little bit it takes me away from the tweet I want to read. I've reported the big to Twitter in past but there was no response. I'll update the review as soon as bug is resolved."
5,False,4,Awesome but has few bugs.,i-am-human,2019-09-22 09:37:46,"Twitter help me stay connected with important people across the globe, unlike Facebook and google twitter never used all these mind games for politics. Never did used users data and shared with other third parties. That‚Äôs why twitter is outstanding and simply the best. The one bug i want to report is that twitter stays on and doesn‚Äôt let the device automatically turn display off. Sometimes i leave twitter on and it drain my whole battery. Other apps turns off after not using for a min. I hope this will be fixed in next updates."
6,False,3,You are not fair,Substitute helps,2021-01-03 15:04:54,You removed many right tweet which were not offensive.  Like dr zev you suspended trueindology account without even cross checking. He is a far better learned man than the best in your team in history. You propagate hate violence in a very clandestine way. Look at black life matters. Without any provocation. Wasn‚Äôt corona then on peak. How many were infected. You allow Malaysian ex pm or pm tweet justifying killing ( France episode ) not suspend his account permanently. You try to regulate news this is my feeling after all this year on Twitter.  But surely cannot deny THAT ITS BECAUSE OF THIS SM MANY GOT EXPOSED. BUT your foe is very selective for sure. People are slowly shifting to other micro message platform.
7,False,5,I suspended but still can see twitter moment and enjoy my favorite topics,9_and,2020-11-12 21:46:22,"Twitter is one social platform which is strict about policies, and maybe for privacy . I maybe suspended for mistake and filed an appeal but still I see my Twitter updates and everything.

8,False,4,What the hell are you doing?,Neelabh2006,2018-03-30 11:05:03,I am using twitter since last two years and there was no problem at all. Today I was scrolling down the posts and suddenly a page came in front of me saying that my account is blocked. Then I made another account and after five minutes again a page came in front of me saying that your account has blocked. I even rarely post a tweet and just see the posts. Please reply and tell why it all happened. I would have given 5 stars but I will not because of this problem and I will not give you 5 stars until you solve my problem.
9,False,5,Twitter Connects World !,rahul1071,2021-01-13 19:16:06,Twitter is a non biased platform that allows be to see genuine world information !

10,False,4,A bad 2FA (2 Factor Authentication),BN781152,2020-04-06 04:03:00,"Well I foolishly enrolled my account for 2FA on Twitter not knowing the repercussions.
I use Twitter to keep tab on current affairs and hardly post anything. The 2FA is more of an headache than a security. SMS take 5 to 6 hours to be received. By that time I am already logged out. Even worst I am regularly requesting help from Twitter support and they don‚Äôt bother reverting to a single complaint/email. It has forced me to delete the app well after using it for a long time.
Excellent support Twitter keep it up and one day you might not have anyone to support."
11,False,3,Problem with storage,Dibyajyoti85,2021-08-24 04:52:25,"If you have ever checked the ‚ÄòDocuments & Data‚Äô section for Twitter in ‚ÄòiPhone Storage‚Äô, you will see that Twitter stores much more data on the phone than other apps. This is a programming design flaw on the part of Twitter. They feel they have an unlimited right to the user‚Äôs phone storage space. Despite Twitter being an important idea and app, their design philosophy regarding storage space on people‚Äôs phones is not ideal.

If anyone at Twitter is reading this, please try to solve this problem. Look at the other apps on your phone and you will realise what I am trying to convey."
12,False,1,Don‚Äôt fix what isn‚Äôt broken,Sunil-Sunny,2021-11-17 19:33:15,"The constant nudging towards an algorithmic timeline instead of a chronological one is getting more and more irritating. Previous versions of the app allowed for a choice between setting home or latest tweets as the default, but for some reason they‚Äôve taken a step backwards and now revert back to home every time the app opens (they have the nerve to offer to remove the latest tweets tab instead of the home tab; unfortunately, that seems to be here to stay permanently) The last thing I want is Facebook/Instagram 2.0 with tweets from several hours or days ago at the top of my timeline instead of what‚Äôs actually happening currently.

17,False,3,Need better tweet notifications management,AfoodNazi,2018-08-24 16:25:25,"So I have multiple tweet notifications enabled for multiple accounts. So whenever they tweet, I get notified. 
So if I accidentally open my notification bar or just the twitter app, on the app all the tweets, usually some 20-30 of them just vanish away. Fix it. 
I don‚Äôt want to see them go away. It defeats the purpose. Why can‚Äôt they just stay if I open my notification bar?
My tweet notifications would just vanish away (cleared away of you will) on their own when I open the twitter app sometimes. Or just like that. Fix this for God‚Äôs sake"
18,False,5,Twitter is an amazing platform to share thoughts,dipsy2580,2019-06-24 03:19:24,"Twitter is an amzazing platform to share thoughts, start discussions, stand against injustice, making changes in the society and meeting like minded people no matter where they live in the world.. However, use of abusive language in every other discussion makes the discussion futile.. Therefore, although the platform is great for putting out your thoughts without fear, you still sometimes feel to quit.."
19,False,1,Verification,VinuVeda,2021-06-25 03:52:09,"I wonder why the social media like twitter is least bothered about verifying the accounts. It‚Äôs shame on twitter since I noticed that the accounts which are tweeting against India or present Govt is been encouraged by blue ticks. 
 I seriously suspect the patriotism of Twitter India as Supporters of truth are not having any blue ticks ( even for few politicians) .
Why Twitter is biased ? Why it‚Äôs doing partiality by suspending the Hindu supporters and BJ P supporters !!!! 
Why the nudity is not banned yet???? 
Why it takes time to suspend the suspicious accounts ? I know my opinion doesn‚Äôt mean anything to your business not it will stop you but sad to know that we trusted the brand which is no different from FB."

21,False,5,Twittertomming,"Col Akash Deep Anand, Veteran",2020-08-21 10:12:10,"Twitter is an excellent platform to voice an opinion in brief. Compared with other social media platforms like Facebook, its better, in that it believes in cautioning about fact checking of certain types of tweets. Exemplars are tweets by Donald Trump about resorting to violence against looters as also his tweets about efficacy of hydroxychloroquine against coronavirus. However, Twitter needs to do more to prevent hate mongering through its medium."
